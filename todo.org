* [fsgif_model] Combine the "statevars" with the State namedtuple
* [fsgif_model] Remove the N factor from Î¸tilde_dis
* [fsgif_model] Stationary initializer for microscopic model
  If the microscopic model is heterogeneous, initialization takes a long time
  because of the huge arrays involved. Since there's no point in wasting cpu cycles
  on a "precise" initialization, it would be better to just use population averages
  for this.
